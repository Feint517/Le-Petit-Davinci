Today's Work Update
Added Serie 2 (size comparison exercises) to the kids learning app. Here's what I finished:

Created 8 new PNGs for different objects (animals, tools, etc.) and added them to assets folder
Updated pubspec.yaml to include the new asset path
Built a new data model with SizeComparisonItem, ItemGroup, and SizeOption classes
Made SizeOption handle different scaling factors (1.0, 0.7, 0.5) to show the same image in different sizes
Extended the AssociationController to handle size comparison logic
Added isInSeries2 getter to branch logic between Serie 1 and Serie 2
Implemented selection tracking for picking the largest item
Created animated circle feedback using CustomPainter
Built the SizeComparisonContent widget to display Serie 2 exercises
Added auto-validation after selection
Improved navigation between series with special handling for end-of-series
Enhanced feedback with snackbars, icons and helpful error messages
Connected everything to the subject detail screen so users can access the new exercises

The app now has both simple matching exercises and size comparison tasks. Kids can practice identifying which object is the largest in each group, with visual feedback when they make a selection.
